# Personal Portfolio

## Introduction
This website was designed to showcase my work as a new website developer. It contains a brief personal introduction, links to the projects I've worked on, and a link to my email address and GitHub repository. Ideally, this website could be shown to potential employers to demonstrate the extent of my coding abilities.

## Usage
All parts of the webpage are visible on the homepage and can be viewed by scrolling down. For ease of access, there is also a navar in the page header with links to all three sections of the portfolio( "About Me", which contains my personal introduction; "Work", which consists of screenshots and links to projects I've completed in the past; and "Contact", which contains my email address and a link to my GitHub portfolio).

To visit any of the websites I've worked on, go to the "Work" section, scroll down to the screenshot of the project you're interested in, and click on the indigo button containing the project name. This will take you directly to that project's website.

To email me, go to the "Contact" section and either copy my email or click on the email itself to be sent to your preferred mailing app with my email address already written in (please note that the second option will only work if your preffered app supports mailto requests). To visit my GitHub repository, click on the link titled "GitHub Profile."
